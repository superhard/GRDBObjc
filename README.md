### Indulge yourself with a little Swift

It happens that we developers maintain and develop Objective-C applications, and wish we could inject more and more Swift into them.

Rewriting a whole application from scratch is often not a reasonable option, despite the intense appeal of Swift. We preserve the legacy Objective-C code that represents years of development, and isolate Swift in the few features that can easily be plugged on to the Objective-C body.

In such a mixed application that has an Objective-C trunk, the few Swift leaves are sometimes hampered by their foreign foundations. Maybe the imported Objective-C does not look very Swifty. Maybe we dream of Swift alternatives that offer superior solutions.


### FMDB in a Swift World

We at [Pierlis](http://pierlis.com) feel this itch quite acutely with FMDB. FMDB does a tremendous job, but GRDB does even better.

In 2015, GRDB was an internal project heavily inspired by FMDB. Three years and four versions of Swift later, this library has reached API stability, and offers a strong toolkit focused on application development. Fundamentals are the same: GRDB speaks SQL just as well as its venerable precursor. It offers the same robust concurrency guarantees. Yet GRBD adds that inimitable Swift taste, and features such as database observation and record types that are nowhere to be seen with FMDB.

For example, let's compare two equivalent code snippets that load an array of application models. With GRDB, it gives:

```swift
struct Player: FetchableRecord { 
    ...
}

let players: [Player] = try dbQueue.read { db in
    try Player.fetchAll(db, "SELECT * FROM player")
}
// use players array
```

FMDB composes another kind of poetry:

```swift
struct Player {
    ...
    init(dictionary: [AnyHashable: Any]) { ... }
}

var queryError: Error? = nil
var players: [Player] = []
dbQueue.inDatabase { db in
    do {
        let resultSet = try db.executeQuery("SELECT * FROM player", values: nil)
        while resultSet.next() {
            let player = Player(dictionary: resultSet.resultDictionary!)
            players.append(player)
        }
    } catch {
        queryError = error
    }
}
if let queryError = queryError {
    throw queryError
}
// use players array
```

You may think: "I never use FMDB like that!". Indeed error handling with FMDB is a pain to read and write, and barely nobody does it. And yet this kind of robustness is what allows your application to run safely in the background on a [locked device](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/iPhone/Conceptual/iPhoneOSProgrammingGuide/StrategiesforImplementingYourApp/StrategiesforImplementingYourApp.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40007072-CH5-SW21), for example. GRDB is concise, won't miss any error, and yet runs the code above [much faster](https://github.com/groue/GRDB.swift/wiki/Performance) than FMDB.


### Going Further with GRDB

[Database observation](https://github.com/groue/GRDB.swift#database-changes-observation) is a ready-made GRDB feature that will save you the hours developing it on top of FMDB.

For example, GRDB comes with high-level tools such as [FetchedRecordsController](https://github.com/groue/GRDB.swift#fetchedrecordscontroller), and the companion library [RxGRDB](http://github.com/RxSwiftCommunity/RxGRDB) which lets you observe database changes in the reactive way. Since observation happens at the SQLite level, it won't be fooled by raw SQL updates, foreign key cascades, or even SQL triggers. Don't miss a single commit:

```swift
let request = SQLRequest<Player>(
    "SELECT * FROM players ORDER BY score DESC LIMIT 10")

// Observe request changes with FetchedRecordsController:
let controller = FetchedRecordsController(dbQueue, request: request)
controller.trackChanges {
    let players = $0.fetchedRecords // [Player]
    print("Players have changed")
}
try controller.performFetch()

// Observe request changes in the reactive way:
request.rx.fetchAll(in: dbQueue)
    .subscribe(onNext: { players: [Player] in
        print("Players have changed")
    })
```


### GRDBObjc is the glue between GRDB and your Objective-C code that targets FMDB

One can not simply install FMDB along with GRDB in the same application, and have Objective-C code target FMDB while new Swift code uses GRDB. This won't work well because SQLite won't let two distinct connections write in the database at the same time. Instead, it will fail with an SQLITE_BUSY error as soon as an Objective-C thread and a Swift thread happen to modify the database concurrently. Think of a download operation that completes as the user is editing some value.

Enter GRDBObjc. Very often, all you will have to do is remove FMDB, install GRDB and GRDBObjc, and replace `#import` directives:

```diff
-#import <fmdb/FMDB.h>
+#import <GRDBObjc/GRDBObjc.h>
```

This is enough for most of your Objective-C code that targets FMDB to compile on top of GRDB and GRDBObjc. Of course, the devil is in the detail, and we'll list below a detailed [compatibility chart](#fmdb-compatibility-chart).

The `FMDatabaseQueue`, `FMResultSet`, etc. classes are now backed by GRDB. A database queue initialized from Objective-C is usable from Swift, and vice versa. See the [Installation](#installation) procedure below for detailed instructions.


# Installation

**Mandatory warning**: GRDBObjc is still very young software. It is tested, but does not fuel many real-life apps yet.

Get familiar with the ["Swift and Objective-C in the Same Project"](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/BuildingCocoaApps/MixandMatch.html) chapter of Swift documentation.

Check the [FMDB compatibility chart](#fmdb-compatibility-chart).

Be ready to open a [pull request](https://github.com/groue/GRDBObjc/pulls) if some API you need is missing, or if you discover a bug or a surprising behavior.

**GRDObjc can be installed with Cocoapods:**

1. Make sure your application target compiles Objective-C with Automatic Reference Counting: `CLANG_ENABLE_OBJC_ARC = YES`.

2. Specify in your application target's Build Settings: `SWIFT_VERSION = 4.0`.

3. Replace FMDB with GRDBObjc in your Podfile:
    
    ```diff
    -pod 'FMDB'
    +pod 'GRDBObjc'
    ```

3. Run `pod install`.

4. Replace Objective-C import directives:

    ```diff
    -#import <fmdb/FMDB.h>
    +#import <GRDBObjc/GRDBObjc.h>
    ```

5. Run and test your application: make sure your Objective-C code handles GRDBObjc well.

6. Expose your Objective-C `FMDatabaseQueue` to Swift via the bridging header.

    **Don't use the FMDB APIs from Swift**: that's not the goal of this library! Instead, extract the genuine GRDB `DatabaseQueue` from the `FMDatabaseQueue`, and make sure Swift code only uses GRDB:
    
    ```swift
    import GRDB
    import GRDBObjc
    
    // Some FMDatabaseQueue exposed to Swift via the bridging header:
    let fmdbQueue: FMDatabaseQueue = ...
    
    // The genuine GRDB's DatabaseQueue:
    let dbQueue: DatabaseQueue = fmdbQueue.dbQueue
    ```
    
    See the [demo app](#demo) for a sample setup.


# Demo

The demo application sets up a database in Objective-C using FMDB-compatible APIs, and uses the database from Swift using GRDB.

To run this demo app:

- Download a copy of this repository. 
- Run `pod install` from the `Tests/CocoaPods/TestApp` directory.
- Open `Tests/CocoaPods/TestApp/TestApp.xcworkspace` in Xcode 9.
- Run the app.
- The bridging between Objective-C and Swift happens in the DataStore class, and the bridging header.

# FMDB Compatibility Chart

**GRDBObjc targets compatibility with FMDB 2.7.2.**

GRDB and FMDB usually behave exactly in the same manner. When there are differences, GRDBObjc favors FMDB compatibility over native GRDB behavior.

**Some FMDB features are out of scope for GRDBObjc.** For example, GRDBObjc requires that databases are accessed through the thread-safe FMDatabaseQueue: you won't be able to create a naked FMDatabase instance.

**Some other FMDB features have not been ported to GRDBObjc yet.** If some API you need is missing, please open a [pull request](https://github.com/groue/GRDBObjc/pulls).

- [FMResultSet](#fmresultset)


### General compatibility warnings

**NSDate**: by default, FMDB stores and reads dates as numerical unix timestamps. GRDBObjc does the same, for compatibility's sake. However, GRDB stores [dates](https://github.com/groue/GRDB.swift/blob/master/README.md#date-and-datecomponents) as `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS.SSS` strings. It can natively load dates from unix timestamps, though.


### FMDatabaseQueue

    ```objc

    // consequences, to do so. Don't use an FMDatabase connection
    // outside of a protected block.
